Project Overview
Build a comprehensive client portal application that streamlines the client onboarding, project management, and communication process for a software consulting firm. The application should have two sides:

Admin Dashboard: For internal use by the sales team and back office manager to manage client onboarding, track project status, and monitor analytics.
Client Portal: For clients to view project status, submit requirements, access invoices, and sign contracts.
The application should replace the current manual process that relies on email templates with an automated system that guides clients through a structured onboarding journey.
